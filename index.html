			The current rendition of the Jets began play as the Atlanta Thrashers in the 1999&#45;2000 NHL season. However in May 2011 True North Sports &amp; Entertainment then bought the team and relocated the franchise from Atlanta, Georgia to Winnipeg prior to the 2011&#45;12 season (the first NHL franchise to relocate since the Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997). The team was renamed the Jets after Winnipeg's original WHA/NHL team, which relocated after the 1995&#45;96 season to become the team now known as the Arizona Coyotes.
